# CopyTrack
CopyTrack helps you to track the location (file path, link, etc.) where you copy.

Imagine you copy some text from a browser page and paste it to your note application. If you want to record where the text is copied, you have to copy the web address and paste it aside the text.

Indeed, the system clipboard usually records such clues. For example, if you copy from a Chrome page, the system clipboard has an item "HTML Format" which contains the URL of the page. 

CopyTrack extracts such clues underneath the system clipboard, including web page address and Office Word file location. Such information is application specific since different applications use the system clipboard in different ways. Typically, the output of CopyTrack can be used combined with automation software like [Quicker](getquicker.net) to collect fragmentation information you are browsing, such as the title of the web page, the location of the file, and the process name of the application, etc.
